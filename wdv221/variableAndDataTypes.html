<script>
    <!-- <p>1. Define a variable called schoolName. Display the variable in the console. *Review the value of a variable that has been defined but has not been assigned a value.</p> -->
    //Defining a variable called schoolName and displaying it in the console.
    let schoolName;
    console.log(schoolName);
</script>

<script>
    <!-- <p>2. Assign &quot;DMACC&quot; to schoolName. Display the variable in the console.  *The quotes make this a String data type.</p> -->
    //Assigning "DMACC" to schoolName and displaying it in the console.
    schoolName = "DMACC";
    console.log(schoolName);
</script>

<script>
    <!-- <p>3. Assign the value 42 to schoolName. Display the variable in the console. *This changes the datatype of the variable from a String to a number. Notice that a JavaScript variable changes datatype based upon it contents.</p> -->
    //Assigning the value 42 to schoolName and displaying it in the console.
    schoolName = 42;
    console.log(schoolName);
</script>

<script>
    <!-- <p>4. Define a variable called courseName and assign it a value of 'WDV221 Intro Javascript'. Use document.write() to display the value of the variable within the following paragraph instead of courseName shown below.</p> -->
    //Concatenating the variable courseName within the paragraph using document.write().
    let courseName = 'WDV221 Intro Javascript';
    document.write(`Hello! Welcome to <em>${courseName}</em>.`);
</script>

<script>
    <!-- <p>5. Define a variable called testScore and assign it a value of 100.00. Use console.log() to display the value of the variable. *Notice how JavaScript treats the .00.</p> -->
    //Defining a variable called testScore and displaying it in the console. The console will show that JavaScript treats 100.00 as 100.
    let testScore = 100.00;
    console.log(testScore);

<script>
    <!-- <p>6. Define a variable called courseGrade. Assign it a value of 88.65. Use console.log() to display the value of the variable. *Notice how JavaScript treats this number.</p> -->
    //Defining a variable called courseGrade to see how JavaScript treats decimal numbers and displaying it in the console.
    let courseGrade = 88.65;
    console.log(courseGrade);

    <!-- <p>7. Define a variable called courseCompleted. Give it a value of false. Use console.log() to display the value of the variable. *Notice this is NOT a String datatype. true and false are reserved word within Javascript.</p> -->
    //Defining a variable called courseCompleted with a boolean value of false and displaying it in the console.
    let courseCompleted = false;
    console.log(courseCompleted);
</script>

<script>
    <!-- <p>8. Assign a value of &quot;false&quot; to courseCompleted. Make sure and use the &quot;&quot; to make this a String datatype. Use console.log() to display the value of the variable. *Notice the difference between 7 and 8.</p> -->
    //Assigning a string value of "false" to courseCompleted and displaying it in the console to notice the difference between boolean and string data types.
    courseCompleted = "false";
    console.log(courseCompleted);
</script>

<script>
    <!-- <p>9. Create a variable called stringType. Assign it a value that makes the variable String data type. Use console.log() to display the variable stringType</p> -->
    //Creating a variable called stringType with a string value and displaying it in the console.
    let stringType = "I love JavaScript!";
    console.log(stringType);
