                <h3>What is the difference between Dark, Milk, and White Chocolate?</h3>
                <p>Chocolate comes in different varieties based on its cocoa content and added ingredients. Dark chocolate is rich in cocoa solids and contains no milk, giving it a bold, less sweet flavor. Milk chocolate has less cocoa but includes milk, making it creamier and sweeter. White chocolate contains no cocoa solids at all, only cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, which gives it its light color and smooth, sweet taste.
