      <h2>Help Save the Koala's</h2>

      <p class="dropcap">
        There is currently no legislation, anywhere in the country, that can
        protect Koalas and Koala habitat in Australia. The listing of the koala
        as “vulnerable” under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity
        Conservation Act in 2012 changed nothing. This is supposed to be the
        premier law for protecting Australia’s environment, yet it is powerless.
        By the time you read this page the bulldozers may already be working,
        but it is not too late to take action. Below we have listed some of the
        things that might make a difference.

      <h3>What you can do if you live in a Koala area:</h3>
      <ul class="about-unordered-list">
        <li>
          Plant Koala food trees. Don’t forget out find out which kinds of gum
          trees are the favorites of Koalas in your area.
        </li>

        <li>
          When out driving, ask your family and friends to be very careful not
          to hit wildlife crossing roads, especially at night. Remember, Koalas
          are most active at night.
        </li>

        <li>
          Keep your dogs your cats inside at night, to protect all wildlife.
        </li>

        <li>
          If you have a swimming pool, place a sturdy rope into the pool
          attached to a tree or post at the edge, so that if Koalas fall into
          your pool, they are able to climb out safely.
